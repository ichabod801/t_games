INITIAL_PURCHASES = """
You have ${} to spend on the following items:

    * Oxen: You can spend $200 to $300 on your oxen. The more you spend,
      the faster you'll go, because you have better animals.
    * Food: The more you have, the less chance there is of getting sick.
    * Bullets: $1 buys a box of 50 bullets. You will need bullets for
      attacks by animals and bandits, and for hunting food.
    * Clothing: This is especially important for the cold weather you will
      face in the mountains.
    * Miscellaneous Supplies: This includes medicine and other things you
      will need for sickness and emergency repairs.
"""

OPTIONS = """
fort-mod= (fm=): The maximum the forts can overcharge. Defaults to 0.5 (50%).
gonzo: Equivalent to 'money = 550 fort-mod = 1 max-bang = 4'.
max-bang= (mb=): How hard it is too shoot. 1-7, 1 is hardest, defaults to 7.
money= (m=, $=): How much money you start with. $400 - $1000, defaults to $700.
"""

RULES = """
This program simulates a quest over the Oregon Trail from Independence,
Missouri to the Oregon City. You family of five will complete the quest in five
to six months -- if you make it alive.

At the beginning you will need to provision for the trip. You can spend all of
your money at the start of the quest, or you can save some of your money to
spend at forts along the way when you run low on supplies. However, items
cost more at the forts. You can also go hunting along the way to get more
food.

Whenever you have to use your trusty rifle along the way you will see the words
'type bang'. The faster you type 'bang' and hit the return key, the better luck
you'll have with your rifle.

In general, the commands each day are stop (at the fort, if you see one), hunt
(for food), or continue (without stopping).

What are your tactics:
