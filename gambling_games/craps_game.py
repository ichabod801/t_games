RULES = """
A player is set to be the shooter (the person who rolls the dice). The base
game of craps goes as follows: The first roll in the round is the come out
roll. On the come out roll the shooter "wins" if they roll a 7 or 11 on two
dice. They "lose" on the come out roll if they roll a 2, 3, or 12. Any other
roll sets the point. The shooter continues to roll, "winning" if they re-roll
the point and "losing" if they roll a 7.

At the end of a round where the shooter "wins" or "loses," they start over
again with a new come out roll. The exception is if the shooter gets a point
and then loses with a roll of 7. In that case, the dice pass to the next
player, who becomes the shooter for a new come out roll.

The base game is not really the game. The real game is making various bets on
the die rolls. The shooter can easily bet that they will "lose," and then if
they "lose," they win money. The bets are described below. The only real
restriction that the base game places on betting is that the shooter must
make a pass or a don't pass bet for each come out roll.

To play, specify which bet you want to make. Then you will be asked how much
you want to wager on the bet. When you are done betting on a particular roll,
enter 'done' or just hit return.

Your score in the results and statistics will be how much money you won
(positive) or lost (negative). This means you can calcuate your total winnings
or losses by multiplying you average score times the number of games you have
played.

BETS:
Pass (Right): A bet that the shooter will "win". Pays 1:1
Don't Pass (Wrong): A bet that the shooter will "lose". Note that a don't pass
    bet is not resolved on a 12 on the come out roll. It remains in play for
    the next come out roll. Pays 1:1
Come: This bet is like a pass bet that treats the next roll as a new come out
    roll. So it wins if the next roll is 7 or 11, loses if the next roll is 2,
    3, or 12; and otherwise a point is set and the bet wins if the point is
    rolled before a seven and loses if a seven is rolled first. Pays 1:1
Don't Come: This is the don't pass equivalent of the come bet. Pays 1:1
Odds: Any of the above bets can have an odds bet placed on them after a point
    is set. This pays out at true odds that the point will (or won't for don't
    pass/don't come odds) be rolled before a 7. This is a key bet in craps, as
    it is the only fair bet (no house edge) in the game. To make this bet, bet
    the base bet plus "odds", such as "pass odds" or "don't pass odds." for
    come/don't come odds, you must state the point as well, such as "come odds
    4." Odds bets may be made with a higher maximum, often depending on the
    point the odds are on. Payouts are 2:1 for 4 or 10, 3:2 for 5 or 9, and
    6:5 for 6 or 8. The reverse odds are payed for don't pass/don't come odds.
Place: A bet that a specific number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10) will be rolled
    before a 7. Pays 9:5 on 4 or 10, 7:5 on 5 or 9, and 7:6 on 6 or 8.
Buy Bet: A place bet that pays true odds. However, you must pay a 5%
    commission to make the bet. Pays out as Odds bet.
Lay Bet: The reverse of a buy bet, betting that a 7 will be rolled first. It
    also pays true odds (as a don't pass odds bet), and requires a 5%
    commission to be paid.
Hard Way (Hard): A hard way bet can be played on 4, 6, 8, or 10. It is a bet
    that the number will be rolled as a pair before it is rolled otherwise (and
    before a seven is rolled). It pays out 7:1 for 4 or 10, 9:1 for 6 or 8.

PROPOSITION (SINGLE-ROLL) BETS:
(To make a proposition bet, type "prop" or "propositon" and the name of the
    bet.)
2 (snake eyes/aces): Wins if the next roll is a 2. Pays 30:1
3 (ace-deuce): Wins if the next roll is a 3. Pays 15:1
11 (yo): Wins if the next roll is an 11. Pays 15:1
12 (boxcars/midnight/cornrows): Wins if the next roll is a 12. Pays 30:1
Any 7: Wins if the next roll is a 7. Pays 4:1
Any Craps (craps/three-way): Wins if the next roll is a 2, 3, or 12. Pays 7:1
C&E: Wins if the next roll is a 2, 3, 11, or 12. Pays 7:1 on 11, 3:1 otherwise.
Field: Wins if the next roll is 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Pays 1:1, or 2:1
    if the 2 or 12 are rolled.
Hi-lo (2 or 12): Wins if the next roll is either a 2 or a 12. Pays 15:1
Horn: Wins if the next roll is 2, 3, 11, or 12. Pays 27:4 if 2 or 12 is
    rolled, 3:1 if 3 or 11 is rolled.
Whirl (world): Wins if the next rolls is a 2, 3, 11, or 12. Pays 26:5 if 2 or
    12 is rolled, 11:5 if 3 or 11 is rolled, and pushes (remains in play) if
    the 7 is rolled.

Some bets, including proposition bets, have their maximum bet determined by
the maximum payout on the table (typically 3 times the maximum bet). You can't
bet so much that you would win more than the maximum payout.

OTHER COMMANDS:
Bets (b): See the bets you currently have in play.
Done (d): Finish betting on the next roll.
Remove (x): Some bets can be taken back after being made. This command will
    show you your removable bets and allow you to take them back.
Roll (r): Finish betting and roll the dice.

    A game of Craps. (game.Game)

    Basic play is that every one gets a chance to bet, then the shooter throws,
    and then bets are resolved. Basic program flow is player_action gets the bets,
    handles everything else as a command. Done command checks for shooter, if so
    rolls and resolves bets. Each bet has it's own resolution method, which is
    found with getattr using the internal bet name from the bet_aliases attribute.
