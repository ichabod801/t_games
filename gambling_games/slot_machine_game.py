Ampersand

Cost per play: 1 buck

Payouts:
Two Alphasands                 (@-!-@):  1 buck
Two Alphasands and an Asterisk (@-@-*):  2 bucks
Three Dollars                  ($-$-$):  4 bucks
Three Factorials               (!-!-!):  6 bucks
Three Octothorpes              (#-#-#):  8 bucks
Three Ampersands               (&-&-&): 10 bucks

Ampersand only has one play.

The Ampersand machine is based on the original Liberty Bell, the first slot
machine. The Liberty Bell was designed by Charles Fey in 1895. The play is
the same, but the symbols are different, and Liberty Bell cost a nickel.

Eight Ball

Cost per play: 1 buck

Payouts:
Split Pair      (4-0-4):  1 buck
Left Pair       (2-2-5):  2 bucks
Right Pair      (9-1-1):  2 bucks
Three of a Kind (6-6-6):  9 bucks
Downer          (5-4-3): 11 bucks
Upper           (1-2-3): 12 bucks
The Lotus       (1-0-8): 24 bucks
The Wheel       (8-0-1): 24 bucks

One or more eights in the result doubles the payout, so the Lotus and the
Wheel payout 48 bucks total. Downers and uppers must be sequences in order,
and the Lotus and the Wheel must be those exact numbers.

Eight Ball only has one play.

FULL_HOUSE_PAYOUTS = """
Full House

Cost per play: 5 bucks

Payouts:
Pair                  2 bucks
Password              4 bucks
Password Pair        12 bucks
Two Pair             15 bucks
Three-of-a-Kind      23 bucks
Purity               30 bucks
Full House          801 bucks
Four-of-a-Kind     1300 bucks
Xyzzy             77000 bucks
Five-of-a-Kind   100000 bucks

A password has at least one digit, at least one symbol, at least one upper
case letter, and at least one lower case letter. A purity has only numbers,
symbols, or letters. A full house is a pair and three-of-a-kind. Xyzzy can be
any case.

Getting a full house with mutliple plays doubles every other play you score on.
Getting a pair and a three-of-a-kind on separate plays doubles both of them.
This can happen mutliple times. For example, if you get two pair and a three-
of-a-kind, both pairs are doubled and the three-of-a-kind is doubled twice,
once for each pair.

Full House has one, three, or five plays. One play is the middle row. Three
plays is all three rows. Five plays is all three rows, the up angle, and the
down angle. The up angle goes diagonally up from the lower left and then
back down to the lower right, and the down angle goes diagonally down from
the upper left and then back up to the upper right. For example:

1-2-3-4-5
X-y-Z-z-Y
!-@-#-$-%

With the above three rows, the up angle play would be !-y-3-z-%, and the down
angle play would be 1-y-#-z-5.
"""

OPTIONS = """
gonzo (gz): Equivalent to 'stake=1'.
stake (s): How much money you start with (defaults to 100).
"""

RULES = """
At the start you choose which game (type of slot machine) you want to play.
Pick one, and enter the spin command. The cost of the machine will be auto-
matically deducted from your stake. The reels will spin, as shown on the
screen, and based on the final values, you may get a payout in return.

Some machines will have more than row in the final output, and will allow you
to make multiple plays each spin. To make more than one play, you entere the
number of plays you want to make as an argument to the spin command, such as
'spin 3'. Alternatively, you can change the default number of plays from 1
using the plays command.

Note that the spin command has many aliases, including pull, s, and p. Ad-
ditionally, you can just enter return, and the reels will spin with the default
number of plays.

You can change games with the switch command ('switch game'). You can also use
the switch command to change to a different machine of the same type ('switch
machine'). This resets the wheels of the machine.

The payouts command will give you the payouts for the current machine.

The Seven       (?-?-?-?): 2626 bucks

The Seven Words that give the max payout are secret, but the Ginger Oracle
knows. Pairs and three of a kind can be in any order. Three letter words
must be either the first three letters or the last three letters. All words
must be in order.

Seven Words has three rows and one, two, or three plays. One play plays the
center row, two plays plays the top and bottom row, and three plays plays all
three rows.
