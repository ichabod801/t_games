"""

RULES = """
The goal is to get a higher total than the dealer, without going over 21. Face
cards count as 10, aces can be 1 or 11, and all other cards are face value. A
two card hand worth 21 is called "blackjack," and beats all other hands.
Winning with blackjack pays out at 3:2.

After you bet, you get two cards up, and the dealer gets one card up and one
card down. If either you or the dealer has blackjack, that is dealt with right
away. Otherwise you can continue to get hit (get another card) until you are
ready to stand (stay with the cards you have). If you go over 21 you lose.

If you are betting on multiple hands (send the hands= option), you can enter
one bet and it will be applied to all of the hands. If you are playing
multiple hands, you can specify which hand you want to act on with a number.
For example, 'hit 2' will hit your second hand. If you do not specify a hand
number, the command will apply to the lowest numbered open hand.

You may increase your bet up to double at any point, on the condition that you
get one and only more card. If you have a pair, you may split it into two
hands, and get another card for each hand (you must bet the same amount for
the second hand). As the first action of your hand, you may surrender to get
half of your bet back.

If you stand, the dealer reveals their hole card, and draws cards until they
get 17 or higher. If they bust (go over 21) or get a lower value than you, you
win.

Your score in the results and statistics will be how much money you won
(positive) or lost (negative). This means you can calcuate your total winnings
or losses by multiplying you average score times the number of games you have
played.

COMMANDS:
Double (d): Increse your bet up to double and get one more card. If you are
    not doubling the bet, specify the bet after the command.
Hands: Change the number of hands you are playing.
Hint: Get a hint about how to play a hand.
Hit (h): Get annother card.
Split (sp): Split a pair to create two hands.
Stand (s): Stick with the cards you have.
Surrender (su): Give up your hand in exchange for half your bet back.

Any command may take a hand number from 1 to n, for times when you have more
than one hand. If no hand number is given, the first open hand is assumed.
