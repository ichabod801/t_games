# The options for Crazy Eights.
OPTIONS = """
change= (c): The rank that allows you to change suits. (default = 8)
change-match (cm): The change suit card must match the discard's suit or rank.
change-set (cs): The change suit card only changes to it's own suit.
draw= (d): The rank, typically 2, that forces the next player to draw that many
    cards without playing any.
draw-one (d1): A player who can't play only has to draw one card.
easy= (e): The number of easy bots in the game. (default = 2)
empty-deck (ed): What to do when the deck is empty: pass (players can pass
    instead of drawing), reshuffle, or score. (default = score)
medium= (m): The number of medium bots in the game. (default = 2)
multi-score (ms): Each players scores the points in the largest hand minus the
    points in their own hand.
one-alert (1a): A warning is given when a player has one card.
one-round (1r): Only play one round.
psychotic (@, gonzo, gz): The four special ranks are set randomly, and change
    every deal.
reverse= (r): The rank, typically A, that reverses the order of play.
skip= (s): The rank, typically Q, that skips the next player.

To set a rank option to no rank, use ! instead of a rank character.
"""

# The rules for Crazy Eights.
RULES = """
Each player is dealt 5 cards, 7 in a two player game. The top card of the deck
is discarded face up. Each player in turn must discard a card face up that
matches the suit or rank of the top card on the discard pile. Any 8 may always
be played, and allows the player to pick a new suit to match. If a player
can't (or doesn't want to) play any cards, they may draw from the deck until
they can (or choose to) play a card.

When a player runs out of cards, the cards in all the other hands are added up
(face cards are 10, eights are 50, all other cards are face value), and the
player who ran out of cards scores that many points. If the deck runs out of
cards, the player with the least points in their hand scores the difference
between their points and the points in each hand. In the case of ties, the
points are split between the tied players. After scoring, all cards are
shuffled into the deck and the game is started again.

The first player to get 50 points times the number of players wins the game.
