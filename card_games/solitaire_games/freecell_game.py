RULES = """
Cards on the tableau build down in rank and alternating in color. Cards are
sorted to the foundation by suit in ascending rank order. Any card at the top
of a tableau pile may be moved to one of the free cells. Empty tableau piles
may be filled with any card from the top of another tableau pile or one of the
free cells.

Technically, cards may only be moved one at a time. However, the computer
keeps track of how large a stack you could move one card at a time, and allows
you to move a stack that size as one move. For example, if you have two free
cells, you can move a stack of three cards one at a time: one each to a free
cell, then third to the destination card, then the two cards back off the free
cells. So if you have two empty free cells, the game lets you move three cards
as one.
"""

OPTIONS = """
baker (b): Building is done by suit (Baker's Game).
cells= (c=): The number of free cells available. 1-10, defaults to 4.
challenge (ch): The twos then the aces are dealt on the bottom row.
egnellahc (eg): The aces then the twos are dealt on the bottom row.
fill-free (ff): The free cells are filled with the last four cards from the
    deck.
gonzo (gz): Equivalent to 'cells = 2 fill-free piles = 10 supercell'
kings-only (ko): Only kings can be used to fill free cells.
piles= (p=): The number of tableau piles. 4-10, defaults to 8.
supercell (sc): One random card in each pile is turned face down.
"""

STACK_HELP = """
The number of cards you can move at one time depends on the number of empty
free cells and the number of empty lanes. The formula for how many you can
move is (1 + C) * 2 ^ L, where C is the number of empty cells and L is the
number of empty lanes*.

For the mathphobic:

          Cells
Lanes 0  1  2  3  4
  0   1  2  3  4  5
  1   2  4  6  8 10
  2   4  8 12 16 20
  3   8 16 24 32 40

If you are moving the cards to a lane, don't count that lane.

* The formula using the rpn command would be: 1 C + 2 L ^ *
