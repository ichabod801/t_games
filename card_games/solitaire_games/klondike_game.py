The cards are dealt in a triangle of seven piles, the first pile having one
card, and each pile to the right having one more card.

Cards on the tableau are built down in rank and alternating in color. Cards
are sorted to the foundations up in suit from the ace. Empty tableau piles may
be filled with a king or a stack starting with a king.

Cards from the stock are turned over three at a time. The stock may be gone

    In college I knew people who played Klondike by playing every card they could
    as soon as they could. But you can have better outcomes by delaying some
    moves, especially when managing the stock. So I used to say, "I could not only
    write a program to play Solitaire, I could write a program to play Solitaire
    for you." Here it is.

    made_moves: The moves made this game, to prevent loops. (set of str)
