Help for solitaire games. (?)

Cards are represented by a two character string. The first is the number of
their rank (for 2-9) for the first character of their rank (jokers are rank
X). The second character is the first letter of their suit. So the Two of
Hearts is 2H and Jack of Clubs is JC. ?? representes a face down card, and
-- represents an empty space where a card was or could be.

There are various commands for the standard moves in a solitaire game:

    * build: Build stacks on the tableau.
    * free: Move cards to free cells.
    * lane: Move cards to empty tableau piles.
    * match: Match pairs of cards together.
    * sort: Move cards to the foundations.
    * turn: Turn cards over from the stock.

In addition, the undo command will take back moves and the auto command will
sort multiple cards at a time. Help is available for all of these commands.

You can also just enter one or two cards without a command. The game will try
to look for a move and make one if it can find one. If two cards are given, it
will first try a build move, and if that doesn't work it will try to match the
cards. Otherwise the order of moves the system looks for is:

    1. Try to sort the card to a foundation.
    2. Try to build the card on another card.
    3. Try to match the card with another card.
    4. Try to move the card to a free cell.
    5. Try to move the card to an empty lane.

For games with multiple decks of cards, see also 'help multi-deck'. And be
sure to check the rules for the specific game you are playing.
"""

MULTI_DECK_HELP = """
Solitaire games with multiple decks bring about extra issues for text-based
games. If you want to build the Two of Spades onto the Three of Diamonds,
there may be two Two of Spades available to move and/or two Three of Diamons
to build them on.

The first way to deal with this is to be specific when possible. If you just
type '2S' to move the Two of Spades onto the Three of Diamonds, it might get
moved on to the Three of Hearts. So be clear with '2S 3D'. You can be more
specific with location identifiers. The format for cards with location
identifiers is RS-AN (Rank, Suit, Area, Number). The area can be F (free
cells), R (reserve), T (tableau), or W (waste). The number is only needed for
reserve and tableau piles, and can be from 1 (the first/leftmost) to the number
of piles. It defaults to one, for cases where there is only one reserve pile.
Note that using just a number for a location identifier is assumed to be
refering to a tableau pile.

If the move made is still not the one you intended, you can use the alternate
command (alias alt) to pick an alternate version of the move. This does not
penalize you in terms of the move count. You can add location identifiers as
arguments to the alternate command. The first one refers to the (current)
location of the card you want to move, and the second (if given) indicates
where you want to move it to.
"""

SCORE_HELP = """
Scores are standardized for all solitaire games. You start with zero points,
and lose one point for each card in the deck (not counting decorative cards,
like the Queens in Quadrille). You then lose a further point for every move,
including undos (and when you undo, you don't get the point back for the move
you are undoing). You gain five points every time you sort a card. If you win,
you get a bonus five points for every card that has been sorted. If you win
without undoing you get a further bonus of five points for every card that was
sorted at the end of the game. That is, for every card sorted since the last
move that didn't sort a card to the foundations. For scoring purposes, every
card moved to the foundation counts as sorted, whether it was moved there with
a sort move or a match move.

    A generalized solitaire game. (game.game)

    As an example of how this generally works: the foo command is handled by
    the do_foo method, which parse the command and uses the foo_check method
    to confirm a valid move. The foo_check method checks basic rules common
    to all games, and then uses the foo_checker attribute (a list of
    functions) to check rules specific to the game.
