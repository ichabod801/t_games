"""
rule_checkers.py

These are rule checking and dealing functions for the Solitaire and
MultiSolitaire classes in solitaire_game.py. They are in their own file for
greater readability.

The parameter list for each type of function:
    * build checkers: game, mover, target, moving_stack
    * dealers: game
    * lane checkers: game, mover, moving_stack
    * match checkers: game, card, match
    * pair checkers: game, mover, target
    * sort checkers: game, card, foundation

Each rule checker returns a string containing a message clarifying any error
found. If that string is empty, the move is valid (as far as that rule is
concerned).

For the reasoning behind the existence of this file, see the wiki.
