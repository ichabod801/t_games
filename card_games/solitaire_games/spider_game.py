# The rules of Spider.
RULES = """
Spider is two deck game, with ten tableau piles. Four of the tableau piles
start with six cards, the rest start with five cards.

Cards on the tableau can be built down in rank regardless of suit. However,
only stacks of a single suit can be moved as a unit. Otherwise cards must be
built one at a time.

If you ever build a stack that goes from king to ace in the same suit, the
whole stack will automatically be sorted.

Turning cards over from the stock deals one face up card to the top of each
tableau pile. You may not turn over cards from the stock if you have any empty
tableau piles.

Options:
one-suit (1s): The deck is all one suit (spades).
open (o): All tableau cards are dealt face up.
relaxed-turn (relaxed, rt): You may turn over cards from the deck when you
    have empty tableau piles.
two-suit (2s): The deck has only two suits: hearts and spades.
