easy= (e=): How many easy bots you will play against. (default = 2)
face=: The ranks that have their face value. This is used to reset default
    non-face values. Face cards will have a value of 10.
gonzo (gz): Equivalent to zero=4/k reverse=a jokers=2 99=9/x skip=2 minus=j.
jokers= (j=): The number of jokers in the deck. Their default value is 99.

medium= (m=): How many medium bots you will play against. (default = 2)

plus-minus= (+-=): The ranks that can be positive or negative. It can be one
    rank or multiple ranks separated by slashes.
reverse= (r=): The rank that reverses the order of play.
skip= (s=): The rank that skips the next player.
zero= (0=): The ranks valued at 0. It can be one rank or multiple ranks separated
    by slashes.

To set a rank option to no rank, use ! instead of a rank character.

RULES = """
Each turn you play a card, adding it's value to the running total. You must
correctly state the new total when you play a card. For example, if the total
to you is 81, and you wanted to play the five of diamonds, you would enter
'5d 86' If you can't play a card without taking the total over 99, you must
pass, and lose one of your three tokens. At that point the hands are redealt
and the total is reset to zero. If you lose all of your tokens, you are out
of the game. The last player with tokens wins.

Cards are face value with face cards being 10, with the following exceptions:
    A: 1 or 11
    4: 0
    10: -10 or 10
    K: 0

In addition, a 4 reverses the order of play and a 3 skips the next player's
turn. Nines take the total to 99, no matter what the previous total was.

The tokens command will show you how many tokens each player has left.
