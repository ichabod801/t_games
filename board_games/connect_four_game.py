Connect Four was originally published by Milton Bradley in 1974.
"""

OPTIONS = """
bot-level= (b=): How good the computer opponent is. Can be easy (e),
    medium (m), or hard (h). The default is medium.
columns (c): How many columns the board should have (4-35, default 7).
gonzo: Equivalent to 'columns = 17 rows = 18 pop'.
pop (p): Allow pop moves, where you remove a piece of yours that is at the
    bottom of a column.
rows: (r): How many rows the board should have (4-20, default 6).
"""

RULES = """
Connect Four is played on a grid six high and seven wide. Players alternate
placing a piece of their color in one of the columns. The piece played becomes
the top piece in the column. The first player to get four pieces in a row,
orthogonally or diagonally, is the winner. If all of the spaces on the board
are filled, the game is a draw.
