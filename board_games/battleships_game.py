RULES = """
You layout your ships on your board by specifying two squares using the board
coordinates on the edges of the board. Only you can see where your ships are.
Each ship takes up one or more squares on the board. Ships must be arranged
orthogonally, and cannot be orthogonally adjacent to each other.

Instead of specifying the start and end squares of a ship, you may respond
with 'random' or just 'r', and the game will place the ship randomly for you.

Then you and your opponent simultaneously fire shots at each other's boards.
You are told if the shot is a hit or a miss. If all of the squares on a ship
are hit, that ship is sunk, and the person who sunk it is informed. If all of
your ships are sunk, you lose the game.

You will be shown two grids, with the columns labelled 0-9 and the rows
labelled A-J. You call shots (and place ships) by using letter-number
coordinates, such as A8. The top grid represents your opponents board, and the
bottom grid represents your board. Hits are marked 'X', misses are marked '/',
and ship squares not yet hit (on your board only) are marked 'O'.

The winner's score is the number of un-hit squares that they had left.
