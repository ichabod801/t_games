OPTIONS = """
black (b): Play as black. If neither black are or white options are used, the
    color of your pieces is determined randomly.
difficulty= (d=): How many tenths of a second the computer player gets to
    choose their move (defaults to 20).
fen= (f=): The FEN for the starting position. Note that any spaces in the FEN
    string must be replaced with pipes (|).
opening= (o=): The opening position to start with. Options include Caro-Kann,
    French, Indian, Italian, Pirc, Queens-Gambit, Ruy-Lopez, and Sicilian.
unicode (uni, u): Show the unicode chess piece characters, if your terminal
    supports them.
white (w): Play as white. If neither black are or white options are used, the
    color of your pieces is determined randomly.
"""

RULES = """
Each player takes turns moving a piece, starting with the white (capitalized)
pieces. If one piece ends in the same square as an opposing piece, the opposing
piece is captured and removed from the board. Your king may not be moved to a
square where it could be captured. If you have no legal moves left, you are
checkmated, and you lose the game.

Each piece moves differently:

    * Pawns: Pawns can move one space straight forward without capturing, or
      one space diagonally forward while capturing. On their first move, pawns
      may move two space straight forward.
    * Knights: Knights move twos square vertically and then one horizontally,
      or two squares horizontally and then one square vertically. Knights may
      move through other pieces, but must end on an empty or capturing square.
    * Bishops: Bishops move any number of squares diagonally.
    * Rooks: Rooks move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
    * Queens: Queens move any number of sqaures diagonally, horizontally, or
      vertically.
    * Kings: Kings move one square in any direction.

Special moves:

    * En Passant: If a pawn moves two squares on its first move and ends up
      next to (horizontally) an opposing pawn, the opposing pawn may capture
      it as if it had only move one space, but only if this is done
      immediately.
    * Promotion: If a pawn makes it all the way across the board, it becomes
      a queen (technically it can become any piece, but this version does not
      support that).
    * Castling: If a king and a rook have not moved, and there are no pieces
      between them, and none of the intervening squares are attacked, they may
      castle. The rook moves next to the king, and the king hops over the rook
      to the other side. This is done in the interface by moving the king two
      squares toward the rook.

Entering Moves:

Each square on the board is identified by coordinates as indicated by the
letters along the bottom and the numbers along the side. So the white king
starts on e1. To move a piece, simply enter the square it is on and the
square you want to move it to. Alternatively you can use algebraic notation or
ICCF numeric notation.

    Note that the Sunfish board is always from the perspective of white. So there
    are a lot of reversals and cases changes of the board and the moves in the code
    for the wrapper. Also, 'if self.player_index' is frequently used as a proxy for
    'if the current player is playing black' in those sections of the code.
