from-zero (fz, f0): Calculates the inital values from 0 (see above).
genus= (g=): The genus of the graph (#edges - #nodes + 1).
nodes= (n=): The number of nodes in the graph. Defaults to 5-10 at random.
"""

RULES = """
The game is made up of a bunch of nodes, each of which is a neighbor to one or
more of the other nodes. Each node has a dollar value to it, which may be
negative. Nodes with a negative dollar value are considered to be in debt.

Two moves are available in the game. You can have a node donate one dollar to
each of it's neighbors, or you can have a node take a dollar from each of its
neighbors. The aliases for the donate move are d and -, the aliases for the
take move are t and +.

The game is won when all nodes are out of debt (that is, all nodes have a
value of zero or more).

See the Numberphile video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ&t=3s)
for more details.

The initial values of the graph are normally calculated by assigned random
values from -n to n (where n is the number of nodes) to each node, and then
randomly normalizing the values based on the genus and the ease options. The
from-zero option starts all the values at 0, and adds or subtracts from node
values randomly until the total based on the genus and the ease is reached.
