OPTIONS = """
betting (b): Instead of tokens going out of the game, they go to the winner of
    the challenge.
challenge (chal): Add a bot with different challenge heuristics to the game.
double (dbl): Add a double trouble (challenger + liar) bot to the game.
gonzo (gz): Equivalent to 'betting tokens=1 two-rerolls'.
honest (abe): Add an honest (mostly) bot to the game.
liar (lr): Add a dishonest (sometimes) bot to the game.
tokens= (t=): Change the number of tokens each player has. (default = 3)
one-six (16): Ones count as sixes.
one-wild (1w): Ones are wild.
two-rerolls (2r): Each player can roll the dice twice before stating their claim.

# The rules for Liar's Dice.
RULES = """
There are five dice. The first player rolls them secretly, and announces what
they rolled. They can lie about what they rolled if they want. If the next
player thinks they are lying, they can challenge the current player. If the
current player is lying, they lose a token. If they are telling the truth,
the person who challenged loses a token.

If the next player accepts the current player's claim, the dice pass to the
next player. They can reroll any of the dice passed to them and then they must
make a new claim (they must also announce how many dice they rolled). The new
claim must be higher than the previous player's claim. Then the next player in
order gets a chance to challenge.

The claims are made in terms of poker hands. The order of hands, from highest
to lowest, is:
    * Five of a kind
    * Four of a kind
    * Full house
    * Straight
    * Three of a kind
    * Two pair
    * Pair
    * High card
All five dice are announced and count toward claims being "better" than the
previous claim. So four fives and a three is better than four fives and a two.

Each player starts with three tokens. The last person with tokens left wins
the game.
